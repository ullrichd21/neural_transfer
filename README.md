ART 187 Final Project Submission
By Danny Ullrich

# Statement
This project started without much direction, I have a passion for messing with computers and because artificial intelligence has always been an interest I decided to experiment with that. At first I thought it would be interesting to see famous paintings done in the styles of each other but that ended up being rather boring and lackluster. I found so much more interest in specifically the mona lisa in pop art styles. They had so much pop (pun intended) and really changed the feeling of the painting. It was interesting to see what elements of both the input image (the Mona Lisa) and the input style image, that the Ai found important. I think this project successfully shows not only the power of Ai but also the impact of style and medium as well as artistic choices.
